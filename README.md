Implementation of the LLVM tutorial creating a compiler for 'Kaleidoscope' 
(working for llvm v. 2.9.). Currently comprises the Lexer, Parser, and AST
creation par, and so doesn't yet rely on llvm libraries, and compiles, as is,
fine with clang++ and g++. 

Note: doesn't win prizes for beauty as is. It's a first draft. It also doesn't really do anything of value - moved on to other project after.
